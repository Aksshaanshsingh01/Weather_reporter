# Weather_reporter
A beginner-friendly Python script that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. It prompts the user for a city name and displays the current temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed in a clean, readable format. Great for those starting with APIs, HTTP requests, and JSON data parsing.
